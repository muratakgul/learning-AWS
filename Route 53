Route 53 is a managed DNS
Route 53 has load balancing feature through DNS
Routing policy feature
You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone
There is $12 dollar one time fee for a hostname
It is a global service, there is no region selection

In AWS, the most common records are:
	A: hostname to IPv4
	AAAA: hostname to IPv4
	CNAME: hostname to hostname
	Alias: hostname to AWS resource
	
Route 53 can use:
	pulic domain names you own or buy
	private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs
	
DNS Records TTL (Time to Live)
	TTL is mandatory for each DNS record
	HighTTL: Less traffic on DNS, possibly outdated records (e.g. 24 hr)
	LowTTL: More traffic on DNS, records are outdated for less time, easy yo change records (e.g. 60 second)
	
	CNAME vs Alias
		CNAME: Points a hostname to any other hostname: app.mydomain.com --> blabla.anything.com
		CNAME --> Only for non root domain
		CNAME: is not free
		Alias: Points a hostname to an AWS Resource: app.mydomain.com --> blabla.amazonaws.com
		Alias --> works for root domain and non root domain
		Alias: free of charge
		Native health check

Simple Routing Policy
	Use when you need to redirect to a single resource
	You cannot attach health checks to simple routing policy
	If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client. Simple load balance feature

Weighted Routing Policy
	Control the % of the requests that go to specific endpoint
	Helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version for example
	Helpful to split traffic between two regions
	Can be associated with Health Checks
	60% of the traffic go to first EC2, 30% go to second EC', 10% go to third EC2 for example

Latency Routing Policy
	Redirect to the server that has the least latency close to us
	Super helpful when latency of users is a priority
	Latency is evaluated in terms of user to designated AWS Region
	Germany may be directed to the US(if that is the lowest latency)
	
Failover Routing Policy
	In order to create failover routing policy, we need to define Health Check first
	When we create first failover routing policy, we need to associate created health check as primary 
	When we create second failover routing which will be secondary and no need for health check association
	If something wrong with the priamry EC2, this policy will direct the request to the secondary
	
GeoLocation Routing Policy
	Different from Latency based
	This is routing based on user location
	Traffic from the UK should go to this specific IP 
	Should create a default policy (We directed two location, then the last one should be default)
	
GeoProximity Routing Policy
	Route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of users and resources
	Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defines bias
	To change the size of the geographic region, specify bias values:
		more traffic to the resource: increase bias number
		less traffic to the resource: decrease bias number
	Resources can be AWS or Non-AWS resources
	You must use Route 53 Traffic Flow (advanced) to use this feature
	
Multi Value Routing Policy	
	Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
	Want to associate a Route 53 helath checks with records
	Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi Value query

3rd Party Domains and Route 53
	Route53 is also domain registrar like GoDaddy and Google Domains
	Domain Registrar != DNS (but each domain registrar usually comes with some DNS feature)
	If you buy your domain on 3rd party website, you can still use Route 53
		create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
		Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 name servers
