Encrytion 101
	Encryption in flight (SSL)
	Server side encryption at rest
	Client Side encryption
	
AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
	Anytime you hear "encryption" for an AWS service, it is most likelt KMS
	AWS manages keys for us
	Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
	
	KMS - Customer Master Key (CMK) Types
		Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
		Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
	User Keys created in KMS: $1 /month and also pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)
	Anytime you need to share sensitive information... use KMS
		DB passwords
		Credentials to external service
		Private key of SSL sertificates
	Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code!
	Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
	KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
	If DATA > 4KB, use envelope encryption
	
SSM Parameter Store
	Secure storage for configuration and secrets
	Optional seemless encryption using KMS
	Serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK
	Version tracking of configurations / secrets
	Notification with CloudWatch Events
	Integration with CloudFormation
	
AWS Secrets Manager
	Newer service, meant for storing secrets
	Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days
	Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
	Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)
	Secrets are encrypted using KMS
	
CloudHSM
	HSM --> Hardware Security Module
	KMS is used to manage the software for encryption
	You manage your own encryption keys entirely (not AWS)
	HSM device is tamper resistant, FIPS 140-2 level 3 compliance
	CloudHSM clusters are spread accross multi AZ (HA) - must setup
	Supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption
	No free tier available
	Must use the CloudHSM Client Software
	Redshift supports CloudHSM for database encryption and key management
	Good option to use with SSE-CMK
	
AWS Shield (DDoS Protection)
	AWS Shield Standard
		Free servicethat is activated for every AWS customer
		Provides protection from attacks suc as SYN/UDP Floods, Reflection attacks, and other L3/L4 attacks
	AWS Shield Advanced
		Optional DDoSmitigation service ($3000 per month per organization)
		Protect against more sophisticated attack on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Route 53
		24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
		
AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
	Protects your web applicaitons from common web exploits (L7)
	Deploy on ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront
	Define Web ACL
		Rules can include: IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
		Protects from common attacks - SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
		Size constraint, geo-match (block countries)
		Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of evetns) - for DDoS protection
		
Amazon GuardDuty
	Intelligent Threat discovery to Protect AWS Account
	Uses ML algorithms, anomaly detection, 3rd party data
	One click to enable(30 days trial), no need to install software
	Input data includes:
		CloudTrail logs
		VPC Flow logs, DNS logs
	Can setup CloudWatch Event Rules to be notified in case of findings
	CaloudWatch Event rules can target AWS Lambda or SNS
	Can protect against CryptoCurrency attacks (has a dedicated "finding" for it)
	
Amazon Inspector
	Automated Security Assessments for EC2 instances
	Analyze the running OS against known vulnerabilities
	Analyze agains unintended network accessibility
	AWS Inspector Agent must be installed on OS in EC2 instances
	After the assessment, you get a report with a list of vulnerabilities
	Possibility to end notifications to SNS
	

Amazon Mecie
	It is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses ML and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS
	Macie helps identify and alert you to sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII)
	For example analyze S3 bucket, if it finds something PII, can notify CloudWatch Events to do something if we want
	
AWS Shared Responsibility Model
	AWS Responsibility - Security of the Cloud
		Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities, and networking) that runs all of the AWS services
		Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS etc...
	Customer Responsbility - Security in the Cloud
		For EC2 instance, customer responsible for management of the quest OS (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM etc...
	Example for S3:
		AWS responsibility:
			Guarantee you get unlimited storage
			Guarantee you get encryption
			Ensure separation of the data between different customers
			Ensure AWS employee's cannot access your data
		Your responsibility:
			Bucket configuration
			Bucket policy/public setting
			IAM user and roles
			Enabling encryption
