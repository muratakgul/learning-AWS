CloudWatch CloudTrail Config

AWS CloudWatch
	Cloudwatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
	Metric is a variable to monitor
	Metrics belong to namespaces
	Up to 10 dimensions per metrics 
	Metrics have timestamps
	Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics
	EC2 instance metrics have metrics "every 5 minutes"
	With detailed monitoring for a cost "very 1 minute"
	The AWS Free Tier allows us to have 10 detailed monitoring metrics
	Note: EC2 Memory usage is by default not pushed, can push by custom metrics
	
	By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch
	You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC' to push the log files you want
	Make sure IAM permissions are correct
	The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too
	
CloudWatch Dashboards
	Great way to setup dashboards for quick access to keys metrics
	Dashboards are global
	Dashboards can include graphs from different regions
	You can change the time zone & time range of the dashbaords
	You can setup automatic refresh (10s, 1m, 2m, 5m, 15m)
	3 dashboards (Ä±p to 50 metrics) for free
	$3 dashboard/month afterwards
	
CloudWatch Logs
	Applications can send logs to CloudWatch using the SDK
	Can define log expiration policies
	Using the AWS CLI we can tail CloudWatch logs
	To send logs to CloudWatch, make sure IAM permissions are correct!
	Encrpytion of logs use KMS

CloudWatch Alarms
	Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
	Alarms can go to Auto Scaling, EC2 Actions, SNS notifications
	Alarm States: OK, INSUFFICIENT_DATA, Alarm
	
CloudWatch Events
	Schedule: Cron jobs
	Triggers to Lamda functions, SQS/SNS/Kinesis Messages
	CloudWatch Event create a small JSON document to give information about the change
	
	
AWS CloudTrail	
	Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS account
	CloudTrail is enabled by default!
	Get an history of events/APIcalls made within your AWS Account by Console, SDK, CLI, AWS Services
	Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs ot S3
	A trail can be applied to All Regions (default)or a single Region
	If resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!
	Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account
	CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline
	And then continously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns and event is sent to S3
	Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail
	To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena
	
	
AWS Config
	Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources
	Helps record configurations and changes over time
	Possibility of storing the configuraion data into S3 (analyzed by Athena)
	Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
		Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
		Do my buckets have any public access?
		How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
	You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes
	AWS Config is a per-region services
	Can be aggregated accross regions and accounts
	
AWS Config Rules
	Can use AWS managed config rules (over 75)
	Can make custom config rules
	Rules can be evaluated/triggered
	AWS Config Rules does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)
	Pricing: No free tier, $2 per active rule per region per month
	

SUMMARY
CloudWatch
	Performance monitoring (metrics, CPU, network, etc...) and dashboard
	Events & Alerting
	Log aggregation & Analysis
CloudTrail
	Record API calls made within your Account by everyone
	Can define trails for specific resources
	Global service
Config	
	Record configuration changes
	Evaluate resource against compliance rules
	Get timeline of changes and compliance

For an Elastic Load Balancer Example:
	CloudWatch:
		Monitoring incomin connections metric
		Visualize error codes as a % over time
		Make a dashboard toget an idea of your load balancer performance
	Config:
		Track security group rules for the Load Balancer
		Track configuration changes for the Load Balancer
		Ensure SSL certificate is always assigned to the LB (compliance)
	CloudTrail:
		Track who made any changes to the Load Balancer with API calls
