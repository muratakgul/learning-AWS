Containers on Amazon ECS, Fargate, ECR & EKS

	Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
	Apps are packaged in containers that can run on any OS
	Use Cases: microservices architecture, lift-and-shift apps from on-premises to the AWS cloud,...
Where are Docker images stored?
	Docker images are stored in Docker Repositories "Docker Hub" in general which is public repository
	Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
		Private repository
		Public repository (Amazon ECR Public Gallery https://gallery.ecr.aws)
		
Docker Containers Management on AWS
	Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
		Amazon's own container platform
	Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
		Amazon's managed Kubernetes (open source)
	Amazon Fargate
		Amazon's own Serverless container platform
		Works with ECS and with EKS
	Amazon ECR
		Store container images
		
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
	Amazon ECS - EC2 Launch Type
		Launch Docker containers on AWS
		Each EC2 Instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
		You must provision/maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
		AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers
	Amazon ECS - Fargate Launch Type	
		Launch Docker containers on AWS
		You do not provision the infrastructure
		It's all Serverless!
		You just create task definitions
		AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based on the CPU/RAM you need
		To scale, just increate the number of tasks. Simple - no more EC2 instances
	Amazon ECS - IAM Roles for ECS
	Amazon ECS - Load Balancer Integraiton
		ALB supported and works for most usecases
		NLB supported
		Elastic Load Balancer supported but no recommended (no advanced feaures - no Fargate)
	Amazon ECS - Data Volumes (EFS)
		Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
		Works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types
		Fargate + EFS = Serverless
		Use cases: persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers
		Note: FSx For Lustre & Windows not supported
		Amazon S3 annot b mounted as a file system
		
ECS Service Auto Scaling
	Automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
	Amazon ECS Auto Scling uses AWS Application Auto Scaling
		Average CPU utilization
		Average Memory utilization
		Metric caming from the ALB
	Target Tracking: scale baaed on target value for a specific CloudWatch metric
	Step Scaling: scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm
	Scheduled Scaling: scale based on a sepcified date/time (predictable changes)
	
Amazon Elastic Container Registry ECR
	Store and manage Docker images on AWS
	Private and public repository
	Fully integrated with ECS, backed by Amazon S3
	Access is controlled through IAM 
	Supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning, image tags, image lifecycle,...
	
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)
	It is a way to launch managed Kubenetes clusters on AWS
	Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scalinf and management of containerized application
	It is an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
	EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes or Fargate to deploy serverless containers
	Use Case: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
	Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic (can be used in any cloud providers)
