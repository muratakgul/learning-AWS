RDS Overview
	Managed PostgreSQL / MySQL / Oracle / SQL Server
	Must provision an EC2 instance & EBS Volume type and size
	Support for Read Replicas and Multi AZ
	Security through IAM, Security Groups, KMS, SSL in transit
	Backup/Snapshot/Point in time restore feature
	Managed and Scheduled maintenance
	Monitoring through CloudWatch
	Use Case: Store relational datasets (REBMS/OLTP), perform SQL queries, transactional inserts/update/delete is available
RDS for Solutions Architects
	Operations: small downtime when failover happens, when maintenance happens, scaling in read replicas /ec2 instance /restore EBS implies manuel intervention, application change
	Security: AWS responsible for OS security, we are responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, authorizong users in DB, using SSL
	Reliability: Multi AZ feature, failover in case of failures
	Performance: depends on EC2 instance type, EBS volume type, ability to add Read Replicas, Storage auto-scaling & manuel scaling of instances
	Cost: Pay per hour based on provisioned EC2 and EBS
	
Aurora Overview
	Compatible API for PostgreSQL / MySQL
	Data is held in 6 replicas, across 3 AZ
	Auto healing capability
	Multi AZ, Auto Scaling Read Replicas
	Read Replicas can be Global
	Aurora database can be Global for DR or latency purposes
	Auto Scaling of storage from 10GB to 128TB
	Define EC2 instance type for Aurora instances
	Same security / monitoring / maintenance features as RDS
	Aurora Serverless - for unpredictable / intermittent workloads
	Aurora Multi-Master - for continous writes failover
	Use Case: same as RDS, but with less maintenance / more flexibility / more performance
Aurora for Solution Architects
	Operations: less operations, auto scaling storage
	Security: AWS responsible of OS security, we are responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM Policies, authorizonf users in DB, using SSL
	Reliability: Multi AZ, highly avaiable, possibly more than RDS, Aurora Serverless opiton, Aurora Multi-Master option
	Performance: 5x performance (according to AWS) due to architectural optimizations. Up to 15 Read Replicas (only 5 for RDS)
	Cost: PAy per hour based on EC2 and storage usage. Possibly lower costs compared to Enterprise grade database such as Oracle
	
ElastiCache Overview
	Managed Redis / Memcached (similar offering as RDS, but for caches)
	In-memory data store, sub-milisecond latency
	Must provision an EC2 instance type
	Support for clusterinf (Redis) and Multi AZ, Read Replicas (sharding)
	Security through IAM, Security Groups, KMS, Redis Auth
	Backup / Snapshot / Point in time restore featureManaged and Scheduled maintenance 
	Monitoring through CloudWatch
	Use Case: Key/Value Store, Frequent reads, less writes, cache results for DB queries, store session data for websites, cannot use SQL
ElastiCache for Solutions Architects
	Operations: same as RDS
	Security: AWS responsible for OS security, we are responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, users (Redis Auth), using SSL
	Reliability: Clustering, Multi AZ
	Performance: Sub-milisecond performance, in memory, read replicas for sharding, very popular cache option
	Cost: Pay per hour based on EC2 and storage usage
	
DynamoDB Overview
	AWS propriatery technology, managed NoSQL database
	Serverless, provisoned capacity, auto scaling, on demand capacity
	Can replace ElastiCache as a key/value store (storing session data for example)
	High Available, Multi AZ by default, Read and Writes are decoupled, DAX for read cache
	Reads can be eventually consistent ort strongly consistent
	Security, authentication and authorization is done through IAM
	DynamoDB Streams to integrate with AWS Lambda
	Backup/Restore feature, Global Table feature
	Monitoring through CloudWatchCan only query on primar key, sort key, or indexes
	Use Case: Serverless applicaitons development (small documents 100s KB, distibuted serverless cache, does not have SQL query language avaiable, has transactions cacpbility from Nov 2018
DynamoDB for Solutions Architect
	Operaitons: no operations needed, auto scaling cabability, serverless
	Securiy: full security through IAM policies, KMS encryption, SSL in flight
	Reliability: Multi AZ, Backups
	PErformance: single digit millisecond performance, DAX for caching reads, performance does not degrade if your application scales
	Cost: PAy per provisioned capacity and storage usage (no need to guess in davance any capacity- can use auto scaling)
	
S3 Overview
	S3 is a key/value store for objects
	Great for big objects, not so great for small objectsServerless, scaless infinitely, max object size is 5TB
	Strong cinsistency
	Tiers: S3 Standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA, Glacier for backups
	Features: Versioning, Encryption, Cross Region Replications, etc...
	Encryptions: SSE-S3, SSE,KMS, SSE,C, client side encryption, SSL in transit

S3 for Solutions Architects
	Operations: no operations needed
	Security: IAM, Bucket Policies, ACL , Encryption (server/client), SSL
	Reliability: Multi AZ, CRR, very reliable
	Performance: scales to thousands of read/writes per second, transfer acceleration /multi-part for big files
	Cost: pay per storage usage, network cost, requests number
	
Athena Overview
	Fully Serverless database with SQL capabilites
	Used to query data in S3
	Output results back to S3
	Secured through IAM
	Use Case: one time SQL queries, serverless queries on S3, log analytics
Athena for Solutions Architect
	Operations: no operations needed, serverless
	Security: IAM + S3 security

ElastciSearch Overview
	Example: In DynamoDB, you can only find by priamry key or indexes.
	With ElasticSearch, you can search any field, even partially matches
	It is common to use ElasticSearch as acomplement to another database
	ElasticSearch also has some usage for Big Data applications
	You can provision a cluster of instances
	Built-in integrations: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS IoT, and Amazon CloudWatch Logs for data ingestion
	Security through Cognito & IAM, KMS encryption, SSL & VPC

	Cost: pay per node provisioned (similar to RDS)
	Remember: ElasticSearch = Search/Indexing
	
Redshift Overview
	Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but it is not used for OLTP
	It is OLAP - online analytical processing (analyticas and data warehousing)
	10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
	Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
	Massively Parallel Query Execution (MPP)
	Pay as you go go based on the instances provisioned
	Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
	BI tools such as AWS Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it
	Data is loaded from S3, DynamoDB, DMS, other DBs...
	From 1 node to 128 nodes, up to 128 TB of space per node
	Backup&restore, Security VPC/IAM/KMS, Monitoring
	Redshift has no "Multi-AZ" mode -But you can apply incremental snapshot and restore a snapshot in a new cluster
	Snapshot is retained until you delete it
	You can configure Amazon Redshift to automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) of a cluster to another AWS Region
Redshift for Solutions Architect
	Operations: like RDS
	Security: IAM, VPC, KMS, SSL, (like RDS)
	Reliability: auto healing features, cross-region snapshot copy
	Performance: 10x performance vs other data warehousing, compression
	Cost: pay per node provisioned, 1/10th of cost vs other warehouses
	vs Athena: faster queries / joins / aggregations thanks to indexes
	Remember: Redshift=Analytics / BI / Data Warehouse
