AWS CloudFront
Content Delivery Network (CDN)
	Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
	More than 200 Point of Presence globally EDGE LOCATION
	DDod protection, integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall
	Encrpyted traffic with HTTPS

CloudFront  Origins
S3 Bucket
	For ditributing files anc caching them at the edge
	Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identit (OAI)
	CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)

Custom Origin (HTTP)
	Application Load Balancer
	Ec2 Instance
	S3 website
	Any HTTP back-end you want
	
CloudFront Geo Restriction
	You can restrict who can access your distribution
		Whitelist the countries
		Blacklist the countries
	The "country" is determined using 3rd party Geo-IP database
	Use Case: Copyright Laws to control access to content
	
CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
	CloudFront
		Global Edge network
		Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
		Great for static content that must be available everywhere
	S3 Cross Region Replication
		Must be etup for each region you want replication to happen
		Files are updated in near real-time
		Read only
		Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
		
CloudFront Signed URL/Signed Cookies
	You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
	How lon should the URL be valid for?
		Shared content (movie or music):make it short (a few minutes)
		Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
		
	Signed URL: access to individual files
	Signed Cookies: access to multiple files
	
CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL
	CloudFront Signed URL
		Allow access to path, no matter the origin
		Account wide key-pair, only the root can manage it
		Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration
		Can leverage caching feature
	S3 Pre-Signed URL
		Issue a request as the person who pre-signed the URL
		Uses the IAM key of the signing IAM principal
		Limited lifetime
		
CloudFront - Pricing
	CloudFront Edge locations are allaround the world
	The cost of data out per edge locaiton varies (In India twice higher than the US)
	You can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction
		Three Price classes:
			Price Class All (most expensive) best performance
			Price Class 200
			Price Clas 100 (less expensive)
	
CloudFront - Origin Groups
		To increase high-availability and do failover
		One primary and one secondary origin
		If the primary origin fails the second one is used
		
CloudFront - Field Level Encryption
	Protect user sensitive information through application stack
	Adds an additional layer of security along with HTTPS
	Sensitive information encrpyted at the edge cloase to user
	Uses asymmetric encryption
	
AWS Global Accelerator
	You have deployed an application and have global users who want to access it directly
	They go over the public internet which can add a lot of latency due to many hops
	We wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency
	Works with Elastic IP, EC2 Instances, ALB, NLB, public or private
	Provides consistent performance
	Do health check for the applications
	Provides security: only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted and DDoS protection thanks to AWS Shield
	Global Accelerator uses Anycast IP concept to work
	Send request to the closest edge location and send to the origin location with internal AWS network
		2 Anycast IP are created for your application
		The Anycas IP send traffic directly to Edge Location
		The Edge locations send the traffic to your application
		
AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
	Both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
	Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection
	
	CloudFront
		Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos
		Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
		Content is served at the edge
	Global Accelerator
		Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
		Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
		Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming(UDP), IoT, or Voice over IP
		Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
		Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
		It is newer technology than CloudFront
