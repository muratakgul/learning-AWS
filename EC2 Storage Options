EBS vs. EC2 Instance Store vs. EFS

Elastic Block Store (EBS)
	EBS volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
	It allows your instances to persistent data, even after their termination
	They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
	They are bound to a specific AZ (but take a snapshot and restore the snapshot to another AZ is an option)
	They are like "network USB stick"
	Free tier provides 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month
	We can detach from an EC2 instance and attach to onather one quickly
	It has a little bit latency
	EBS - Delete on Termination Attribute (root EBS - attribute enabled, other attached EBS, attribute disabled)
	Root EBS volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated. (we can disable that)
EBS Snapshots
	Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
	Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, bu recommended
	Can copy snapshots accross AZ or region
	
EC2 Instance Store
	If you need high-performance hardware disk, then use EC2 Instance Store
	Better I/O performance
	EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they are stopped (ephemeral)
	Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
	Risk of data loss if hardware fails
	Backups and replication are your responsibility

EBS Volume Types
	gp2 / gp3 (SSD)
	io1 / io2 (SSD)
	st1 (HDD)
	sc1 (HDD)
	
	Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes
	
	General Purpose SSD
		cost effective storage, low latency
		system boot volumes, virtual desktops, development and test environments
		1 GB to 16 TB
		gp3 provides better performance than gp2 (both up to 16000 IOPS)
		
	Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
		critical business apps
		or apps that need more than 16000 IOPS
		great for databases workloads
		io1/io2 (4 GB to 16TB)
		max PIOPS 64000 for Nitro EC2 instances and 32000 for others
		io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GB (at the same price as io1)
		io2 Block Express (4 GB to 64TB) with max PIOPS 256000 with an IOPS
		Supports EBS multi-attach
	
	Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
		cannot be boot volume
		125 MB to 16TB
		Cold HDD - scenarios where lowest cost is important
		
		
EBS Multi-Attach - io1/io2 family
	Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
	Must use a file system that's cluster-aware (not XFS, EX4 etc.)
	Use case:
		Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications such as Teradata
		Appications must manage concurrent write operations
		
EBS Encryption
	Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
	Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
	EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
	Snapshots of encrpyted volumes are encrypted
	Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption - First take a snap for unencrypted and then create volume with encrption option selected
	
EBS RAID Options
	RAID is possible as long as your OS supports it
	RAID 0 and RAID 1 is recommended but RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for EBS
	
  
Elastic File System (EFS)
	Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
	EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
	High available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use
	Uses NFSv4.1 protocol
	Uses secuity group to control access to EFS
	Compatible with Linux based AMI (not Windows)
	Encryption at rest using KMS
	File system scales automatically, per-pay-use, no capacity planning!
	EFS share website files (Wordpress)
	Use Cases:
		Content management
		Web serving
		Data sharing
		Wordpress
		
EFS - Performance & Storage Classes
	1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB+/s throughput
	Performance mode (set as EFS creation time)
		General purpose (default): latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc...)
		Max I/O: higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
	Throughput mode
		Bursting (for 1TB up to 100MB/s)
		Provisioned (for 1TB 1GB/s)
	Storage Tiers 
		Standard: for frequently accessed files
		Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
