CICD:
Continuous Integration
	Developerspush the code to a code repository often (Github/CodeCommit/Bitbucket/etc...)
	A testing / build server checks the code as soon as it is pushed (CodeBuild/Jenkins CI/etc...)
	The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed/failed
	Find bugs early, fix bugs
	Helps to deliver faster asthe code is tested
Continuous Delivery
	Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed
	Ensures deployments happen often and are quick
	Shift away from "one release every 3 months" to "5 releases a day"
	That usually means automated deployment
	Tools: CodeDeploy, Jenkins CD, Spinnaker, etc...

AWS CodePipeline: Orchestrate	
	Code: AWS CodeCommit --> like Github
	Build and Test: AWS CodeBuild --> Jenkins CI
	Deploy and Provision: AWS Elastic Beanstalk - AWS CodeDeploy - CloudFormation

CloudFormation
	Infrastructure as Code
	CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
	Cloudformation creates AWS services for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify
	Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation
	
AWS Step Functions
	Build serverless visual workflow to orchestrate your Lambda functions
	Represent flow as a JSON state machine
	Maximum execution time of 1 year
	Use Cases: Order fulfillment, Data Processing, Web Applications, Any Workflow
	
AWS SWF (Simple Workflow Service)
	Coordinates work amongst applications
	Code runs on EC2 (not serverless)
	1 year max run time
	Example: order fulfilment from web to warehouse to delivery
	Step Functions is recommended to be used for new applications, except:
		If you need external signals to intervene in the processes
		If you need child processes that return values to parent processes

Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)
	It helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and proess vast amount of data
	The clusters canbe made of hundreds of EC2 instances
	Also suports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink
	EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configurationAuto-scaling and integrated with Spot instances
	Uses cases: data processing, ML, web indexing, big data
	
AWS Opsworks
	Chef & Puppet helps you perform server configuration automatically, or repetitive actions
	They work great with EC2 & On Premise VM
	AWS OpsWorks = Managed Chef&Puppet
	It is an alternative to AWS SSM
	Chef&Puppet are open-source tools that work cross-cloud
	
AWS WorkSpaces
	Managed, Secure Cloud Desktop
	Great to eliminate management of on-premise VDI
	On Demand, pay per by usage
	Secure, Encrypted, Network Isolation
	Integrated with MS AD
	Virtual desktops OS types: Linux / Windows
	
AWS AppSync
	Store and sync data across mobile and web apps in real-time
	Makes use of GrapQL (mobile technology from Facebook)
	Integrations with DynamoDB/Lambda
	Real-time subscriptions
	Offilne data synchronization (replaces Cognito Sync)
	Fine Grained Security
	
Cost Explorer
	Visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time
	Create custom repots that analyze cost and usage data
	Analyze your data at a high level: total costs and usage across all accounts
	Or monthly, hourly, resource level granularity
	Choose an optimal Savings Plan (to lower prices on your bill)
	Forecast usage up to 12 months based on previous usage
	
Here's a quick cheat-sheet to remember all these services:
	CodeCommit:service where you can store your code. Similar service is GitHub
	CodeBuild: build and testing service in your CICDpipelines
	CodeDeploy:deploy the packaged code onto EC2 and AWSLambda
	CodePipeline:orchestrate the actions of your CICDpipelines (build stages, manual approvals, many deploys, etc)
	CloudFormation: Infrastructure as Code for AWS. Declarative way to manage, create and update resources.
	ECS (Elastic Container Service):Docker container management system on AWS. Helps with creating micro-services.
	ECR (Elastic Container Registry):Docker images repository on AWS. Docker Images can be pushed and pulled from there
	Step Functions:Orchestrate / Coordinate Lambda functions and ECScontainers into a workflow
	SWF (Simple Workflow Service):Old way of orchestrating a big workflow.
	EMR (Elastic Map Reduce):Big Data /Hadoop /Spark clusters on AWS, deployed on EC2 for you
	Glue:ETL(ExtractTransform Load) service on AWS
	OpsWorks:managed Chef & Puppet on AWS
	ElasticTranscoder:managed media (video, music) converter service into various optimized formats
	Organizations: hierarchy and centralized management of multiple AWSaccounts
	Workspaces: Virtual Desktop on Demand in the Cloud. Replaces traditional on-premise VDIinfrastructure
	AppSync:GraphQL as a service on AWS
	SSO(SingleSign On): One login managed by AWSto log in to various business SAML 2.0-compatible applications (office 365 etc)
