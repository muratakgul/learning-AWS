AWS Snow Family
	Offline devices to perform data migrations
	If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use snowball devices!
	We use snow family for big data because of limited connectivity, limited bandwidth, and high network cost
	We use them as Highly-secure, portable devices:
		-to collect and process data at the edge
		-migrate data into and out of AWS
	Three different devcies:
		Snowcone - 8TB usable
		Snowball Edge - 80TB usable
		Snowmobile -  up to 100PB
		
	Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery
	We put data on these devices, they will be transfered physically and put the data in S3 and data in these devices will be wiped.
	
	Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly! First put the data in S3 and then go to Glacier with S3 lifecycle policy
	
Amazon FSx - Overview
	Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS, and fully managed service
	FSx for Lustre
		Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing
		The name Lustre is derived from Linux and cluster
		It is for ML and HPC
		Storage options: SSD and HDD
		Scale up to 100s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
		Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)
	FSx for NetApp ONTAP
		For NetApp application
	FSx for Windows File Server
		Supports SMB and NTFS
		MS AD integration, ACLs, user quotas
		Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
		Scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
		Storage options: SSD and HDD
		Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect)
		Can be configured to be Multi-AZ
		Data is backed-up daily to S3
		
	Amazon Fsx File Gateway
		Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
		Local cache for frequently accessed dataWindows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, AD)
		Useful for goup file shares and home directories
		
	FSx File System Deployment Options:
		Scratch File System	
			Temporary storage
			Data is not replicated
			Usade:short-term processing, optimize costs
		Persistent File System
			Long term storage
      Data is replicated within same AZ
			Replace failed files withing minutes
			Useage: long-term processing, sensitive data
		

Storage Gateway --> Hybrid Cloud for Storage
	AWS is pushing for hybrid cloud, some part of your infra is on the cloud some of them are in on-premises:
	Due to: long cloud migrations, security requirements, compliance requirements, and IT strategy
	
	AWS Storage Cloud Native Options:
		Block
			Amazon EBS
			EC2 Instance Store
		File
			Amazon EFS
			Amazon FSx
		Object
			Amazon S3
			Amazon Glacier

Amazon Storage Gateway
	Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data in S3
	Use cases: disaster recovery, backup&restore, tiers storage
		
	3 Types of Storage Gateway:
		File Gateway
			Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
			Supports S3 standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA
			Bucket access usinf IAM roles for each File Gateway
			Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
			Can be mounted on may servers
			Integrated with AD for user authentication
		Volume Gateway
			Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
			Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes!
			Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
			Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
		Tape Gateway
			Some companies have backp process usinf physical tapes!
			Use the same processes with tapes but, in the cloud
			Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
			Works with leading backup software vendors
			Backup with iSCSI
			
AWS Storage Gateway Summary
	On-premises data to the cloud --> Storage Gateway
	File acces /NFS --> user auth with AD --> File Gateway (backed by S3)
	Volumes/Block Storage/iSCSI  --> Volume Gateway (backed by S3 with EBS snapshots)
	VTL Tape solution/Backup with iSCSI --> Tape Gateway (backed by S3 and Glacier)
	No on-premises virtualization --> Hardware Appliance
	
  
AWS Transfer Family
	A fully-managed service for file transfers into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS usinf the FTP protocol
	Managed infrastructure, Scalable, Reliable, Highliy Available (multi-AZ)
	Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
	Store and manage users' credentials within the service
	Integrate with existing authentication systems (MS AD, LDAP, Okta, Amazon Cognito, custom)
	Usage: sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP
	Supported Protocols
		AWS Transfer for FTP
		AWS Transfer for FTPS
		AWS Transfer for SFTP
	

STORAGE COMPARISON
	S3: Object Storage
	Glacier: Object Archival
	EFS: Network File system for Linux instances, POSIX filesystem
	FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
	FSx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system
	EBS volumes: Netowrk storage for on EC2 instance at a time
	Instance Storage: Physical storage for your EC2 instance (high IOPS)
	Storage Gateway: File Gateway, Volume Gateway(cache,stored), Tape Gateway
	Snowball/Snowmobile: to move large amount of data to the cloud, physically
	Database: for specific workloads, usually with indexing and querying
