Identity and Access Management (IAM)

It is a global service, does not require region selection.
Root account created by default with AWS account creation. 
Root account should not be used or shared. Use it for just creating an IAM user(s)
Users are poeple within your organization and can be grouped
Groups only contain users not other groups
Users can be member of multiple groups
We can assign JSON based policies to users and groups to do something on AWS.
There are hundreds of defined policies, and also we can create new policies using Visual Editor and JSON file.
We can customize signing URL. It comes with Account ID by default. It is better to change user-friendly name.
We can set up Password Policy which is highly recommended action.
We can set up MFA which is highly recommended.

To access AWS, you have three options:
	AWS Management Console (protected by password and MFA)
	AWS Command Line Interface CLI (protected by access keys, Access keys for Programmatic Access) 
	AWS Software Development Kit SDK for code(protected by access keys, Access keys for Programmatic Access)
Access keys are generated through the AWS Console
Access Key ID is like username
Secret Access Key is like password
Users manage their own access keys, if it is lost we can create the new one through AWS Console
CloudShell is browser-based shell environment. It is kind of terminal of AWS Cloud. We can open more than one session simultaneously.
CloudShell can keep created data for a while even if you close the session.
We assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles. For example; EC2 to access S3 buckets.
Roles can also be assigned to access for another AWS account, web identity for cognito, and SAML 2.0 Federation.
We can create IAM Credentials Reports (account-level) and IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
